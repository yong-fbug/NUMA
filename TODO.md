add label, hide id, remove delete inside on main root and add delete inside of content page
};

[x] - Add a flexible table

Graph-based linking system
topological sortk

-[x] link cards are headache -[x] change the ui and logic for CardCalculator

-[x] a card hold same operator then use of connector to different card -[x] A card can add multiple input/value

-[y] I can't not proceed with Topological sorting because of UI link id selection, if i do it's going messy and hard to understand and if UI it's consume alot of space. But use of a mother and child method. Mother is the entire Card and the result from inputs is the children. I can now create a child node then use of it i can now talk to other cards.
